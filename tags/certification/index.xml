      <description>Last week I passed PW0-105 exam and obtained the CWNA certification:
I work with wireless network since 2005, I began installing some SoHo APs and in the last few years I designed and deployed many bigger networks, some of which are challenging high density environments.
I read manyCisco documents about wifi design and in this year&amp;rsquo;s Cisco Live I attended many session related to wifi. After passing CCNA-W I didn&amp;rsquo;t felt confident enough, I know how to design, install and troubleshoot a wireless network but I wanted to have a deeper knowledge of the technologies involved ant how the protocols work.</description>

      <description>Today I passed this Cisco exam: (642-647) Deploying Cisco ASA VPN Solutions v1.0 (VPN) and my CCSP certification is now updated to the new CCNP(Security).
I&amp;rsquo;ve prepared the exam on the Cisco Press Official Cert Guide. The exam was not very hard, probably because I work on Pix/Asa platforms since 2007. The guide is very complete and actually I&amp;rsquo;ve re-learned some topics and how to deploy SSL and WebVPN in a better way, easyer to manage and to scale.</description>
