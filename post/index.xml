      <title>NFD16 day two - Cisco Project Starship a.k.a. Intersight</title>

      <description>Day two of NFD16 with Cisco. The presentation was split in two parts. First part for Intersight, second part for Tetration.
I&amp;rsquo;ll post here just a few thoughts about Intersight.
Merakify all the servers! What&amp;rsquo;s Cisco Intersight? If you&amp;rsquo;re familiar with cloud-managed devices like Meraki the concept is quite similar.
A Cisco server runs the Device Connector client that links to a central management portal that runs on Cisco DC SaaS.</description>

      <description>Automation is today a word that can be both scaring and exciting at the same time.
The scary part is often related to the question: will robots steal my job?
Federico Pistono says that&amp;rsquo;s ok.
We read articles about how many jobs will not exist anymore soon, and sometimes how new jobs will be create to support automation. The most advanced analysts try to predict how a society can survive with massive unemployment.</description>

      <description>I read this post on Ivan&amp;rsquo;s blog this morning and as often happens it made me think.
The key point is: figure out what your most pressing problem is.
Who should do that? Let&amp;rsquo;s analyze the roles involved in a typical SMB or enterprise.
Vendors Vendors have just one target: sell their products. They can&amp;rsquo;t really customize the product to every business needs so they try to convince the customer the problem their product solve is the problem you have.</description>

      <title>NFD16 day two - Apstra</title>

      <description>Day two of NFD16 started with Apstra and their intent-based networking system.
Intent concept is not as broad as SDN but still vendors have different views of this meaning.
According to Apstra an intent is &amp;ldquo;the definition of the expected outcome&amp;rdquo;. The sum of the intents of a network is the source of truth.
Read Sasha Ratkovic blog post about the definition of Intent Based Networking. The checklist he suggest can be very useful to compare different solutions and spot intent washing strategies.</description>

      <description>First day at Tech Field Day NFD16, I&amp;rsquo;m quite excited to be here among fellow network engineers to share our views on products and technologies.
I&amp;rsquo;m planning to post my takeaways for each vendor with variable lengths based on my knowledge and interest of the specific product.
Today&amp;rsquo;s first presenter is Veriflow. Let&amp;rsquo;s see what Continuous Network Verification is and how it can help to make networks more robust and secure.</description>

      <description>Welcome back to AirPiConsole blog post, this is part two.
If you read part one and followed the configuration steps you should now have a fully working Raspberry Pi Zero W connected to your WiFi network.
You should also be able to connect via Bluetooth to get a console connection without knowing the IP address of the Raspi.
Now it&amp;rsquo;s time to move on and start to actually connect to the serial ports.</description>

      <description>As a network engineer I spend a lot of time with my laptop connected via serial cable to various devices.
Physical serial connection is needed for initial device setup and sometimes per customer&amp;rsquo;s security policy I can&amp;rsquo;t access the network, so I can only use out-of-band management. I also configure many devices at staging lab that I call the &amp;ldquo;Theory room&amp;rdquo; because you know, in theory everything works ;-)</description>

      <description>Summertime usually means a busy period for Network Engineers, customers are on holidays and we have the opportunity to performs all the changes that impact network connectivity.
For me this usually means core switch replacement.
Today I was moving a configuration from an HP8200 to a Cisco 4500, taking care of all the details of ports, trunks, vlans.
From this:

When a task is manual, boring, repetitive and error-prone my automation skills came to help.</description>

      <description>Ansible has been around for I while but I didn&amp;rsquo;t had a chance to play with it so far.
Now the time has come: I manage enough IOS devices with homogeneous configurations in multiple sites without Cisco Prime. Any change is a pain, it&amp;rsquo;s time to automate all the things!
My environment I run Ansible inside Bash on Windows, I don&amp;rsquo;t see any issue or difference than running in an actual Linux box or docker/vagrant/whatever and it permits a better integration with the tools I already use.</description>

      <description>This week I attended and event organized by Cisco TAC in Krakow.
I&amp;rsquo;ve been in may Cisco events (Live, PVT, Pint etc.) but It was the first time for me at a TAC workshop and I was curious about it.
The Agenda Agenda was clear: tree days with TAC engineers presenting best practices for installation and configuration with a clear focus on troubleshooting methods and tools.
I was not disappointed by the contents: marketing was reduced to minimum, all the presenters were skilled TAC engineers and all the sessions were very detailed.</description>

      <description>Today I passed exam CWDP-302 and got CWDP.
To be honest I had to renew my CWNA that was about to expire but I don&amp;rsquo;t really like to renew, I prefer o move forward when I can.
Exam preparation To prepare the exam I read cover-to-cover the official study guide and review some topics on the CWNA study guide.
The study guide is dated 2011 so it covers up to 802.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s time for CLEUR again, for the second year in Berlin, that&amp;rsquo;s 5 years in a row and I still get excited when the date arrives.
I won&amp;rsquo;t repeat many consideration&amp;rsquo;s I&amp;rsquo;ve already made last year.
This year my main focus was security, I attended many FirePower, AMP and FTD sessions. General routing/switching and wireless are topics I can see in other partner events or learn by myself watching recordings later.</description>

      <description>DISCLAIMER
I work in the enterprise market, mostly with routing&amp;amp;switching, wireless, security products from multiple vendors. I have no SDN/cloud/ISP real experience yet. My views here are based upon meetings with vendors pushing SDN solutions and fellow engineers who shared experiences, doubts and some labs to test the products.
After attending a few SDN presentation of various vendors I&amp;rsquo;m starting to make an opinion about SDN myself. Here&amp;rsquo;s what I got so far.</description>

      <description>Last week I had the opportunity to attend a &amp;ldquo;Cisco Meraki Masters&amp;rdquo; session at Meraki HQ in San Francisco.
Meraki Masters is a program that sits on top of CMNA to give partners a deeper view of the Meraki product line, vision and roadmap.
Merakify a.k.a. &amp;ldquo;Don&amp;rsquo;t spend your time doing work a well-trained monkey could do.&amp;rdquo; Meraki has a strong focus on the &amp;ldquo;merakification&amp;rdquo; of the products. Merakification means that all the repetitive tasks a network administrator performs almost on daily basis are now included in the Meraki Dashboard.</description>

      <description>I got inspired by the book &amp;ldquo;The 1 Thing&amp;ldquo; and changed a little bit my behavior about work and training I&amp;rsquo;d like to share here to discuss and improve.
The Background A while ago one guy could setup a bunch of physical servers, install/configure/manage OS, configure network equipment and setup a firewall to connect to the internet.
For some specific software platforms the support of the vendor for installation and maintenance was enough.</description>

      <description>Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to my new website!
I mean site url, content and topics are still the same but but now I use Hugo instead of Wordpress.
Why change Speed: my website got slower and slower. Static pages are fast, very fast.
Easy of use: I started to use markdown to write posts then copy&amp;amp;paste them in Wordpress via browser. This process was slow and required too many steps.</description>

      <description>Office 365 is widely used between many customers. Some of them happen to manage all the Internet connections through a Cisco ASA, not the fancy ASA-X with Firepower, just the plain old 5510.
I was asked to allow Office 365 traffic, looks easy huh?
Step 1: know your enemy After some Google-fu I found Microsoft kindly provides an update list of the IP/subnet/URLs necessary to access various services including Office 365, Lync, OneNOte etc.</description>

      <description>As it often happens, everything begins with a call from a customer with a problem.
The problem is related to WiFi roaming in a warehouse with clients disconnecting from RDP sessions. The clients are industrial PCs installed on forklifts that move quite fast (and dangerously).
Second rule of troubleshooting: measure As the first rule is clearly identify the problem, I skip to the second one.
How can we measure roaming problems?</description>

      <description>The need If you work with Linux machines and you don&amp;rsquo;t use a terminal multiplexer you&amp;rsquo;re doing it wrong.
What is a terminal multiplexer? It lets you switch easily between several programs in one terminal, detach them (they keep running in the background) and reattach them to a different terminal.
The Solution I use tmux, some people prefer sceen, just pick one and learn how to use is.
For tmux users this cheat sheet helps.</description>

      <description>Linux scripting is a skill every network/system engineer should learn in the early stages of the career. Plenty of guides available in the interwebz, The Bash Academy is a good start.
A particular type of scripts are the one-liners: just a line of code to solve a problem.
This is the latest I&amp;rsquo;ve used while testing autossh, check active ssh sessions continuously:
while true; do netstat -an | egrep -e &#39;:22 &#39;; sleep 2s;clear;done  Enjoy!</description>

      <description>The Problem Notes, code and configuration snippets, links, screenshots&amp;hellip; where/how to save them and allow and easy/fast way to tag/search them when needed?
The Solution In my opinion the best software for notes is Onenote today.
One note has a better integration with Windows 10, it&amp;rsquo;s free, supports multiple platforms and the mobile App actually works.
Among all the cool features maybe my favourite is to be able to search text inside the pictures pasted inside a note.</description>

      <description>Hi CLEUR! This year, for the fourth year in a row, I&amp;rsquo;ve attended Cisco Live Europe.
I&amp;rsquo;ve earned the &amp;ldquo;Netvet&amp;rdquo; status, that means my name was on the wall before the keynote, ain&amp;rsquo;t that great? ;-)
Aesthetics apart, this year&amp;rsquo;s event was the biggest I&amp;rsquo;ve attended so far, twelve thousands people in a huge venue (for European standards) and a lot of sessions available.
Here&amp;rsquo;s my recap of the event.</description>

      <description>The problem In my last post about Linux at command I talked about notifications on my mobile.
In most of my automation scripts I prefer notifications to come to my mobile instead of via email or SMS (really? in 2015?) because:
 it is always with me
 I check it thousands times a day (I know you too ;-) )
 it is a preferred channel - a specific app just for that</description>

      <description>Another post on Linux commands, short and simple but very useful: at.
The problem As IT pros we are all comfortable with the change window concept.
This window usually opens at night or during the week-end and sometimes the change actually just requires a few commands on a Linux machine.
The automation The at command allows to schedule a command or script to be run at a specific time.</description>

      <description>After a few posts about Windows software now it&amp;rsquo;s time for Linux.
The problem Working with the Linux bash sometimes requires to type long commands multiple times. Isn&amp;rsquo;t that a motivation strong enough to look for a better way?
The automation Linux alias is quite self-explanatory, it allows to create command aliases like with the familiar Cisco CLI.
A good place to store aliases is .bashrc.

      <description>The problem Install software on Windows and keep it updated is a boring and repetitive task.
Linux and BSD/OSX users can install software from packages and keep it updated with a simple apt-get update;apt-get upgrade command.
Wouldn&amp;rsquo;t it be great to have the same feature on Windows?
The automation Chocolatey is a package manager for Windows fast to install, easy to use and supports thousands of software.
Installation is very simple, just one command:</description>

      <description>The problem As many IT professionals I work quite often on the command line with many command prompts open.
Windows lacks a good native command prompt software so usually you see monitors filled with black terminals that are hard to manage and track.
The automation ConsoleZ allows multiple tabs and to split tabs vertically or horizontally among with many other features.

      <description>The problem Security today is a main concern for every computer user. One of the first problem is how to manage password.
I see many creative solutions around: post-it or paper only, use of the same password for all services, a spreadsheet inside an encrypted zip file&amp;hellip; none of them appear safe or efficient.

For every site I need and IP address, gateway, Wi-Fi network, sometimes proxy, a printer and many other unique network settings.

The automation I used to use netsh scripts to do that but it was hard to maintain.

      <description>I read this blog post from Mattias Geniar and I think he gave a name of a concept I had in my mind from years.
It started a while ago when I tried to find a more efficient ways to do my daily work and it got bigger and bigger up to be almost an&amp;hellip; obsession.
Obsession is actually a negative word related do some sort of mental disorder. Let&amp;rsquo;s say OED could be considered more about automation of boring stuff to be more efficient, a sort of Kaizen applied to IT.</description>

      <description>Today I passed exam VCP550 and got VMware VCP5-DCV certification.
Exam preparation For exam preparation I attended the official training that is mandatory to access the exam. The printed material provided with the training is good enough but I integrated with the great Mastering VMware vSphere 5.5 by Scott Lowe. The official documentation available online for free.
I had some hands-on experience with VSphere, did some installations myself and supported some trouble tickets so even if I don&amp;rsquo;t work every day with VSphere I have a decent knowledge on the topic.</description>

      <description>Scripts, usually I write some because I don&amp;rsquo;t like repetitive tasks and I&amp;rsquo;m lazy, meaning I prefer automation over useless hard work.
Don&amp;rsquo;t know where I found this quote but I like it:
Don&#39;t spend your time doing work a well-trained monkey could do.  Today&amp;rsquo;s request was quite simple: get model and serial number from a bunch of Cisco switches.
I now NEDI, Observium and LibreNMS can do that but I preferred to write a quick script I could use as a one shot tool instead of a complete software solution.</description>

Location The choice of location this time was much better, last year I went to Maastrich through Brussels, most people didn&amp;rsquo;t liked it since it&amp;rsquo;s not easy to reach.
The sessions Session quality is high, mostly vendor neutral, speakers are well prepared and willing to share their knowledge and experiences.
Last year there were more sessions splitted in two different rooms.</description>

More experienced network engineers, as I learn during my CCIE studies, type in a [text language=&amp;ldquo;editor&amp;rdquo;][/text]2 then copy/paste on the CLI.
This approach make easier to spot typos, faster to reuse configuration snippets and to change portions of configuration and more.</description>

      <description>IP addressing design is a topic that follows every networker from the basic to the architect level of experience.
Usually we just pick a random range from RFC1918 and address all the devices.
But then VPN happens, and with VPN comes the risk of overlapping.
How do we fix overlapping? With NAT of course!
In this post I&amp;rsquo;ll show how to use twice NAT to allow VPN connections with overlapping addresses.</description>

This time was the turn of HP ASE - Network Infrastructure 2011 to be renewed as HP ASE - FlexNetwork Integrator V1 and HP ASE - FlexNetwork Architect V2.
Four exams are availale to upgrade, I choose HP2-Z31 - Creating HP Software-defined Networks because I hear a lot about SDN but I had not the opportunity to explore this topic yet.</description>

      <description>SecureCRT is one of my favourite tools, today I had a chance to use it in a way I didn&amp;rsquo;t expected.
A customer called with a problem: he has a radio bridge that sometimes loses connection with the remote unit. The workaround is to reload the base unit. The process is manual, he monitors the radio bridge status and reload when required.
Since the radio bridge is not business critical he doesn&amp;rsquo;t have budget to replace tha radio bridge or troubleshoot the problem, the request was to automate the check/reload process.</description>

 Docker Networking - bridge container to host NIC
  We started with the basics and moved on with adding software, using volumes and then bridging a container to the network.
As a said I&amp;rsquo;m neither a developer or a system administrator, I work as Network Engineer so I&amp;rsquo;m not the main target for Docker but I found it very useful for a specific need and now it&amp;rsquo;s time to join the dots.</description>

 Docker Introduction
 Docker: Install software inside a container
 Docker Volumes
  Today we&amp;rsquo;ll see Docker networking with a very specific target in mind: bridge container to the host network.
This isn&amp;rsquo;t supposed to be the way of work of containers: a container should be created to run a single application so container networking, from the point of view of a Network Engineer, is essentialy a Port Address Translation with a firewall exception.</description>

      <description>In the last post we saw that any filesystem change inside a docker container is lost if not commited to the image.
What if we want to share data between containers?
We can use Docker&amp;rsquo;s Data Volumes and Data Volume Containers.
Data Volumes or Data Volume Containers? Data Volumes feature allows us to mount a local directory from the host inside a container. That looks good but somehow it breaks the concept of isolation between host and container.</description>

      <description>In the first post of this series we left with a running Ubuntu 15.04 container.
Now it&amp;rsquo;s time to install software inside the container.
A container is &amp;ldquo;stateless&amp;rdquo;, meaning any file change inside a container is lost when the container is closed, including software installations.
Install software To install software inside a container any method supported for the Linux distribution is fine.
I usually install Python 2.7, iftop, htop, tmux so let&amp;rsquo;s run a container:</description>

Install docker and first run We can apt-get to install docker on Ubuntu Linux:
apt-get install docker.io  Now start docker service:

_PingInfoView is a small utility that allows you to easily ping multiple host names and IP addresses, and watch the result in one table. It automatically ping to all hosts every number of seconds that you specify, and displays the number of succeed and failed pings, as well as the average ping time._
OS: Windows
License: freeware
How I use it
I find it particularly useful during network migrations to check if all the hosts are available before and after.</description>

The training was organized in short presentations of product features followed by hands-on labs based on all the products available today.
I was suprised to find not only people from small companies or system integrators but more that 50% of the attendees were from Cisco Gold Partners sent to evaluate the products for &amp;ldquo;managed network&amp;rdquo; services. Cloud managed network gear is quite a hot topic today and I expect many projects in the future will involve this kind of solutions.</description>

      <description>Just a quick post since I speak with many network engineers and I notice some confusion about this topic.
Are all 4 pairs of an Cat5e cable used? The answer is.. it depends.
For gigabit speed 1000T all four pairs are used. If 100TX speed is enough we can of course split the cable and double the connections without pulling more cables:
In my specific case I&amp;rsquo;ve used a single cable drop in the garage to connect a humidity/temperature to a 1wire bus sensor while allowing a future connection of an ethernet device.</description>

The training is focused on Cisco Nexus 9000 switches in NX-OS mode.
NX9K can run two different software images, the full ACI image with all the cool SDN stuff and the traditional NS-OX image with some cool features like Python, Rest API, VX-LAN and more.
Now it&amp;rsquo;s time to improve my Python skills and borrow a couple of boxes to do some labs.</description>

      <description>NeDi and Observium are two of my favourites network monitoring tools.
I do like to deploy both, they complete each other and since they&amp;rsquo;re free there is no need to choose. The only problem with the use of two tools is the integration.
Observium has a limitation with host discovery: a device can be discovered only by name and that name must be resolved to an IP via DNS or hosts file.</description>

      <description>Switch configuration includes many tasks, some of them are just boring and error prone.
Vlan port assignment on access switches, excited huh? There can be many vlans (clients, printers, access-point, security cameras and more) and it may not be easy to plan the assignments before the actual installation.
No my friend! In this installation I was lucky enough to deal with Alcatel switches that have a great feature: auto vlan assignments without the hassle of 802.</description>

      <description>Last week I had the opportunity to attend the first Wireless LAN Professionals Conference in Europe.
Wireless is an important part of my job, I designed and managed more than a few wireless networks installations and I know there are many challenges involved, I felt I needed to increase my knowledge so I had pretty high expectations from this event.
The schedule included two tracks of 8 sessions each and ten &amp;ldquo;Ten Talks&amp;rdquo; in one day and a half.</description>

      <description>A couple of days ago I did a planned software upgrade of an HP5406zl.
Since the installed firmware version was quite old it was not possible to update directly to the latest release, an upgrade path must be followed:
This is how it went:

A faulty flash killed the switch so it was replaced with a spare part, an HP5412zl, the same switch but with twelve modules instead of six.</description>

      <description>Log analysis is important to both troubleshoot and understand network devices behaviour.
Tail/less/grep are great tools that can help to filter and search hundreds or thousands lines of logs.
If you prefer a GUI there are a couple of alternatives that can fit well.
For windows users only Log Expert is a great choice with many features but it is not developed since 2012.
[Log Expert](http://www.log-expert.de/) is a Windows tail program (a GUI replacement for the Unix tail command).</description>

Let&amp;rsquo;s talk about MTU. Everything begun today from a ping (it&amp;rsquo;s italian in the screenshot, but you know the output by heart right?</description>

      <description>In the very last day of availability of the CCIE v4 350-001 written exam I&amp;rsquo;ve renewed my CCIE for a couple of years more:

My plan was to recertify with another track - Wireless or Security - but life happens and I took the easy path and did R&amp;amp;S again.
I&amp;rsquo;ve passed the same written exam 3 times. The first time in 2010, followed by a failed lab attempt in 2011.</description>

      <description>Last week I passed PW0-105 exam and obtained the CWNA certification:
I work with wireless network since 2005, I began installing some SoHo APs and in the last few years I designed and deployed many bigger networks, some of which are challenging high density environments.
I read manyCisco documents about wifi design and in this year&amp;rsquo;s Cisco Live I attended many session related to wifi. After passing CCNA-W I didn&amp;rsquo;t felt confident enough, I know how to design, install and troubleshoot a wireless network but I wanted to have a deeper knowledge of the technologies involved ant how the protocols work.</description>

      <description>Wireless traffic packet capture is not easy as wired traffic. Linux and OSX have several solutions but if you&amp;rsquo;re stuck with Windows the first problem is to find a compatible adapter.
My choice is AirPcap, fully compatible with Wireshark and very esay to install.
Install and setup Download and install Wireshark and AirPcap drivers.
Using AirPcap Control Panel, set the channel to listen. Each adapter can listen one channel ad time, that&amp;rsquo;s why there&amp;rsquo;re bundles with 3 adapters if you use channel 1,6,11 in your WLAN.</description>

      <description>Networking is awesome but some tasks may be quite boring and repetitive. For new campus network installations a lot of time is used just to put a basic initial configuration template on switches.
Each vendor has its proprietary method to distribute configs automagically but sometimes the effort to setup the system is simply too much.
A common practice is to prepare a template in a test environment then copy it changing the IP address, hostname and a few other parameters.</description>

Since the Nexus 5000 are connected to an iSCSI storage I&amp;rsquo;ve configured Jumbo frames.
Customer called complaining that MTU isn&amp;rsquo;t correctly set and I must fix it.</description>

Ten years later and 21 Cisco exams later (and a bunch of other vendors), with 2 labs in Brussels, 1 FAIL and 1 PASS, I&amp;rsquo;m still excited about networking and I hope the next ten year will be as valuable and inspired.</description>

Some people still doesn&amp;rsquo;t know what Cisco Live is. Is it an event for pre-sales? A technical training? A party with free beer for nerds? I can say it is it all and much more.
At Cisco Live you have the opportunity to participate in very deep technical sessions, some with hands-on labs, and to talk with the smartest guys in Cisco.</description>

GNS3 maybe is the most famous emulator while others like eNSP for Huawei, Cisco&amp;rsquo;s VIRL, Juniper Junosphere are available or will be available soon.
The big name missing so far was HP. Last December HP announced on Linkedin the availability of a simulator for Comware platform:</description>

Unike the Millenniun Bug that had a clear deadline, IPv6 adoption is a topic that I often discuss with clients but nobody is really willing to do it, even in a test environment.
I studied IPv6 in many Cisco certifications but since they&amp;rsquo;re focused on the infrastructure side of the network, I plan to do some labs myself in the next months.</description>

To prepare the exam I&amp;rsquo;ve used the official study guide along with the documents in the Cisco Design Zone.
The hardest part of the exam preparation was to study technologies I&amp;rsquo;ve never really implemented and to focus on design, scalability and restrictions more than on the commands.</description>

For a project I&amp;rsquo;ll deploy in the next few weeks I had the opportunity to attend an Huawei training.
Huawei provides a fast-track for people already certified with other vendors, three training courses are condensed in just one week but it works if you don&amp;rsquo;t want to hear for the 100th time how STP works ;)</description>

      <description>Console access to devices for a network engineer is almost as important as telnet/ssh access. Usually an usb to serial adapter is required since almost all laptops don&amp;rsquo;t have a serial port. I must admit that a dual or quad serial adapter is in my Amazon wishlist ;-)
I looked for wireless serial adapters, both bluetooth and wifi, and I even thought to build one myself with RaspberryPi. My final choice was Airconsole, now it&amp;rsquo;s time for a review.</description>

      <description>One of the more annoying things of the windows command line is the lack of Shift+Ins to paste the clipboard.
A bit of googling made me discover a very useful software called AutoHotkey.
While I&amp;rsquo;m just beginning to use it it proved to be the perfect tool for the job.
This simple script allows use Shift+Ins to paste the clipboard content inside the Windows console:
#IfWinActive ahk_class ConsoleWindowClass RShift &amp; Ins:: SendInput {Raw}%clipboard% return #IfWinActive I&amp;rsquo;m sure AutoHotkey will be even more valuable as I learn how to use the advanced functions.</description>

On the WLC the command is &amp;ldquo;debug client MAC&amp;rdquo;. The command shows all the events related to the specific client including:
Reassociation received from mobile on AP 00:23:ab:ba:YY:XX that means client moved to the AP with radio MAC 00:23:ab:ba:YY:XX. Since I&amp;rsquo;ve named all the APs and and I&amp;rsquo;ve a map with all the positions, I&amp;rsquo;d like to see the names in the debug instead of MAC.</description>

      <description>I work with WiFi more than I admit to myself and now that I have more time to study outside the CCIE R&amp;amp;S blueprint boundaries it&amp;rsquo;s time to focus on other technologies.
I&amp;rsquo;ve been involved in an interesting high density WiFi project and after a successfull deployment there&amp;rsquo;re some things I&amp;rsquo;d like to check. As Cisco partner my company had support for the network design from the same team involved in London Olympics and Cisco Live!</description>

      <description>My home network is connected to the Internet via radio bridge. The reason is ADSL services were not available a couple of years ago, now it is but since the radio bridge is cheap and works (most of the time) I really don&amp;rsquo;t care to change.
Some time ago I started to notice downtime of the Internet connection, I sent a few emails to the wisp but the answer was always the same: &amp;ldquo;we don&amp;rsquo;t see a problem right now&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>In really enjoyed to read all the blog post of people passing the CCIE lab exam over the years. I&amp;rsquo;ve found the stories very inspirational so now it&amp;rsquo;s time for me to give back.
I started working as a system engineer in 2001 supporting Microsoft Windows 2000 client and server for a bank. I had the opportunity to work with some network engineers for a project and being intrigued by the new world I started to study what seemed to be the right choice for the moment: Cisco CCNA.</description>

An additional CCIE plaque costs 150USD, paper certs cost 15USD.

&amp;ldquo;Alcatel-Lucent Certified Field Expert - ACFE - OmniSwitch R6/R6&amp;ldquo;
OmniSwitch have some proprietary features, like mobile vlans, that may be very useful in some deployments. The new 10K platform with MC-LAG and other featuers seems great as core switch.
The bright side of working for a system integrator is the opportunity to mess play work with many different vendors and accumulate experience with many devices.</description>

The second week confimed the high level of this training, long hours and Brian Dennis showing us a lot of scenarios and how to spot a problem before it happens instead of just troubleshooting it later.
My favorite days were MPLS and Multicast, followed by redistribution and OeR but I must say that I found in every single day something new.</description>

      <description>As a network engineer I deal with digital certificates quite often for EAP-TLS authentication, VPN, and device certificates like on WLC controllers.
Customers that don&amp;rsquo;t need a public certificate just want a valid certificate loaded on the device to make it work. I used to create certificates with OpenSSL, that is flexible and works great but lacks a GUI.
XCA is a Windows application with a nice GUI and great features to create and manage certificates:</description>

      <description>Sometimes customers ask me how they can get provider indipendent IP addresses. Since IPv4 are finished, I looked for IPv6 only.
To apply for Provider Indipentent addresses there are some Contractual Requirements that must be met. It&amp;rsquo;s cleat that IP are assigned to the organization and can&amp;rsquo;t be assigned to third parties, i.e. you&amp;rsquo;re not an ISP.
Direct assignment for users are available on RIPE website, there&amp;rsquo;s an annual fee and a one-time Administration Fee of 2000€:</description>

      <description>Tomahawk is a command line tool for testing network-based intrusion prevention systems (NIPS).
The concept is simple, you can download virus,attacks,exploit pcaps from many sources and save them on the Tomahawk machine. To test an IPS you need tree network interfaces: one for management, one to send traffic and one to receive. If the attack sent on the interface is received on the other interface the IPS didn&amp;rsquo;t filtered it.</description>

      <description>On a customer&amp;rsquo;s network we noticed that the Internet facing router reboots because of a software error. We stumbled on this issue by chance, just because one of the reboots was during a videoconference. Nobody noticed the problem before and they really don&amp;rsquo;t know if the problem was there since the installation of the router a couple of years ago. They have Nagios running to monitor the network, so I&amp;rsquo;ve configured it to monitor the router uptime too.</description>

Wireless music streaming is a very useful feature, but it&amp;rsquo;s limited to use iTunes as source.
Today I bought Airfoil that allows to stream the audio from any running program on PC or MAC.

Now I can stream music from any online service like Grooveshark or Rdio to my home stereo.</description>

The first step is the registration and setup of a tunnel to our IPv4 address. Second step the configuration of the tunnel on our side. The webiste includes many examples of tunnel configuration, in my case Cisco IOS:

What I need is some basic scripting, read and write on a DB, a web interface and integration with network protocols.
After reading some websites, googling a lot, I choose Python that has a simple sintax, many libraries and is widely used so I think I could get support from many forums available.</description>

      <description>A customer called today for a strange issue on their Cisco ASA. They have 60Mbit internet connection and a big event is filling the bandwidth. The session graph is what they are worried about:

This is a perfect example of TCP Sync, well explained HERE. The ISP applies a basic rate-limit rule on the router that causes the packet drops.
Since ISP uses a Cisco router as CPE I&amp;rsquo;ll try to negotiate some QoS policy to avoid the TCP sync behaviour.</description>

      <description>Today I passed Cisco 642-983 DCUCI exam and it was a surprise to see two certifications on my Cisco curriculum:
Cisco Unified Computing Technology Support Specialist
and
Cisco Data Center Support for UC Specialist
The next step would be &amp;ldquo;Cisco Data Center Unified Computing Support Specialist&amp;rdquo; but since VCP is a requirement and is not in my plans I have to skip that cert.</description>

      <description>This week I&amp;rsquo;m attending Cisco DCUCI course in Milan. I have no experience on blade servers or Cisco UC plaftorm and it&amp;rsquo;ll be a great opportunity to learn new topics and move another step towards the datacenter.
I&amp;rsquo;ve prepared for this course watching Cisco PEC videos and reading the two must-read books from Silvano Gai:
 I/O Consolidation in the Data Center
 Cisco Unified Computing System (UCS)
  Cisco provides an emulator for the Cisco UCS , available only to Partners.</description>

      <description>Today I passed this Cisco exam: (642-647) Deploying Cisco ASA VPN Solutions v1.0 (VPN) and my CCSP certification is now updated to the new CCNP(Security).
I&amp;rsquo;ve prepared the exam on the Cisco Press Official Cert Guide. The exam was not very hard, probably because I work on Pix/Asa platforms since 2007. The guide is very complete and actually I&amp;rsquo;ve re-learned some topics and how to deploy SSL and WebVPN in a better way, easyer to manage and to scale.</description>

      <description>I didn&amp;rsquo;t pass the CCIE R&amp;amp;S Lab exam today in Brussels. This was my first attempt.
I have to improve my troubleshooting skills and go deeper in some technologies but I think I can do it.
I don&amp;rsquo;t have plans for the next attempt yet, there&amp;rsquo;re other personal projects that will take most of my free time in the next months. Maybe it&amp;rsquo;ll take a while but I don&amp;rsquo;t give up.</description>

      <description>A quick note about tcp small servers.
DOC-CD says:
&amp;ldquo;The TCP small servers consist of three services: Discard (port 9), Echo (port 7), and Chargen (port 19).&amp;rdquo;
If we do a portscan to a router before and after enabling tcp-small-server with the command:
R(config)#service tcp-small-servers  We can see that these ports are opened:
Starting nmap V. 3.00 ( www.insecure.org/nmap/ ) Interesting ports on (10.1.0.254): Port State Service 7/tcp open echo 9/tcp open discard 13/tcp open daytime 19/tcp open chargen  The DOC-CD misses port 13 corresponding to Daytime Protocol.</description>

      <description>Thou shalt above all, maintain the integrity of the network. Thou shalt have a long term strategic direction. Thou shalt always opt for quality before expediency. Thou shalt meet the requirements, exceed the expectations and anticipate the needs of users. Thou shalt benefit from a successful implementation by careful project planning. Thou shalt provide reliability, availability and serviceability. Thou shalt maintain detailed, timely and accurate documentation. Thou shalt commit to continuous training.</description>

      <title>Autoinstall - Frame Relay</title>
      <link>https://www.ifconfig.it/hugo/post/autoinstall-frame-relay/</link>

      <guid>https://www.ifconfig.it/hugo/post/autoinstall-frame-relay/</guid>
      <description>First of all: autoinstall works only on the first serial interface of the router, don&amp;rsquo;t forget it.
This is the topology for the small lab:
R1 is a TFTP server, it stores R3 configuration in flash.
R3 has no configuration.
R2 interface is configured as follow:
``
interface Serial1/0 ip address 10.0.23.2 255.255.255.0 &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt; ip helper-address 1.1.1.1&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; encapsulation frame-relay ip ospf network broadcast ip ospf 1 area 0 serial restart-delay 0 frame-relay map ip 10.</description>

      <description>Autoinstall is a quite interesting topic, it deserves some labbing.
Start from the DOC-CD as usual, we focus on the LAN implementation first.
You can find HERE the flowchart of the autoinstall process.
This guide is quite clear too:
AutoInstall Using DHCP for LAN Interfaces
This is the topology we&amp;rsquo;ll use:
R1 and R2 will start without configuration.
R3 is the DHCP server that provides TFTP informations to R1 and R2.</description>

      <title>RMON and MIB</title>
      <link>https://www.ifconfig.it/hugo/post/quick-tip-rmon-and-mib/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 02 Mar 2011 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://www.ifconfig.it/hugo/post/quick-tip-rmon-and-mib/</guid>
      <description>RMON is generally an easy task, can be tricky but usually on CCIE workbooks the task are fair. The hardest part for me is to find the MIB to monitor.
This is the task: monitor interface Vlan1, send a trap if it receives more than 100 packets every 30 seconds, send a trap if it goes under 50 packets every 30 seconds.
First step: find Vlan1 ifindex.
R#sh snmp mib ifmib ifindex Vlan99: Ifindex = 10 Virtual-Access2: Ifindex = 13 FastEthernet4: Ifindex = 5 FastEthernet0: Ifindex = 1 FastEthernet2: Ifindex = 3 Loopback0: Ifindex = 12 Null0: Ifindex = 6 Virtual-Access1: Ifindex = 11 &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Vlan1: Ifindex = 7&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; Virtual-Template1: Ifindex = 9 NVI0: Ifindex = 8 FastEthernet1: Ifindex = 2 FastEthernet3: Ifindex = 4  So Vlan1 has ifIndex value 7.</description>

      <description>Conditional debugging is used to filter debugging messages:
R#debug condition ? application Application called called number calling calling card card glbp interface group interface interface ip IP address mac-address MAC address match-list apply the match-list standby interface group username username vcid VC ID vlan vlan voice-port voice-port number xconnect Xconnect conditional debugging on segment pair  A quick example: filter RIP events only for interface Serial1/1.
We just need to enable a debug condition for interface S1/1:</description>

      <description>Snmp v3 is described in many RFC, like RFC3414 and so on.
History and security of the various SNMP versions are easy to find and well known, let&amp;rsquo;s focus on configuration.
SNMPv3 can work in three ways:
 noAuthNoPriv
 authNoPriv
 authPriv
  For the tests I use a Cisco871 as snmp-server and a OSX computer to walk the MIBs.
noAuthNoPriv No authorization, no encryption
Router configuration;
R(config)#snmp-server view noAuthNoPriv internet included R(config)#snmp-server user user1 noAuthNoPriv v3 R(config)#snmp-server group noAuthNoPriv v3 noauth read noAuthNoPriv  Query from OSX:</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;Breaking stupid rules for smart results.&amp;rdquo;
 Not the best book ever but I liked the concept: don&amp;rsquo;t stick to the rules if you feel the rules don&amp;rsquo;t allows to work in and efficient way.
Hacking work is actually intrapreneurship and requires a little anarchic spirit. How can we improve if we never try something different?
