      <description>On a customer&amp;rsquo;s network we noticed that the Internet facing router reboots because of a software error. We stumbled on this issue by chance, just because one of the reboots was during a videoconference. Nobody noticed the problem before and they really don&amp;rsquo;t know if the problem was there since the installation of the router a couple of years ago. They have Nagios running to monitor the network, so I&amp;rsquo;ve configured it to monitor the router uptime too.</description>
