      <description>IPv6 is the evolution that everybody know must be done one day but not today.
Unike the Millenniun Bug that had a clear deadline, IPv6 adoption is a topic that I often discuss with clients but nobody is really willing to do it, even in a test environment.
I studied IPv6 in many Cisco certifications but since they&amp;rsquo;re focused on the infrastructure side of the network, I plan to do some labs myself in the next months.</description>

      <description>Sometimes customers ask me how they can get provider indipendent IP addresses. Since IPv4 are finished, I looked for IPv6 only.
To apply for Provider Indipentent addresses there are some Contractual Requirements that must be met. It&amp;rsquo;s cleat that IP are assigned to the organization and can&amp;rsquo;t be assigned to third parties, i.e. you&amp;rsquo;re not an ISP.
Direct assignment for users are available on RIPE website, there&amp;rsquo;s an annual fee and a one-time Administration Fee of 2000€:</description>

      <title>IPv6 and TunnelBroker</title>

      <description>Inspired by the Packet Pushers Podcast I setup my personal IPv6 tunnel to TunnelBroker.net. Registration is free and the configuration is straightforward.
The first step is the registration and setup of a tunnel to our IPv4 address. Second step the configuration of the tunnel on our side. The webiste includes many examples of tunnel configuration, in my case Cisco IOS:
configure terminal interface Tunnel6 description Hurricane Electric IPv6 Tunnel Broker no ip address ipv6 enable ipv6 address 2001:470:99:15::2/64 tunnel source 1.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;You can either do a planned, careful migration, or you can do it in a panic, and you should know full well that panicking is more expensive.&amp;rdquo; Martin Levy, director of IPv6 strategy for Hurricane Electric</description>
