      <description>IP addressing design is a topic that follows every networker from the basic to the architect level of experience.
Usually we just pick a random range from RFC1918 and address all the devices.
But then VPN happens, and with VPN comes the risk of overlapping.
How do we fix overlapping? With NAT of course!
In this post I&amp;rsquo;ll show how to use twice NAT to allow VPN connections with overlapping addresses.</description>
