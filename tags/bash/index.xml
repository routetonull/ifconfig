      <description>Scripts, usually I write some because I don&amp;rsquo;t like repetitive tasks and I&amp;rsquo;m lazy, meaning I prefer automation over useless hard work.
Don&amp;rsquo;t know where I found this quote but I like it:
Don&#39;t spend your time doing work a well-trained monkey could do.  Today&amp;rsquo;s request was quite simple: get model and serial number from a bunch of Cisco switches.
I now NEDI, Observium and LibreNMS can do that but I preferred to write a quick script I could use as a one shot tool instead of a complete software solution.</description>

      <description>NeDi and Observium are twoÂ of my favourites network monitoring tools.
I do like to deploy both, they complete each other and since they&amp;rsquo;re free there is no need to choose. The only problem with the use of two tools is the integration.
Observium has a limitation with host discovery: a device can be discovered only by name and that name must be resolved to an IP via DNS or hosts file.</description>
