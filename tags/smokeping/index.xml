      <description>My home network is connected to the Internet via radio bridge. The reason is ADSL services were not available a couple of years ago, now it is but since the radio bridge is cheap and works (most of the time) I really don&amp;rsquo;t care to change.
Some time ago I started to notice downtime of the Internet connection, I sent a few emails to the wisp but the answer was always the same: &amp;ldquo;we don&amp;rsquo;t see a problem right now&amp;rdquo;.</description>
