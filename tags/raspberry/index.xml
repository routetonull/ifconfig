      <description>Welcome back to AirPiConsole blog post, this is part two.
If you read part one and followed the configuration steps you should now have a fully working Raspberry Pi Zero W connected to your WiFi network.
You should also be able to connect via Bluetooth to get a console connection without knowing the IP address of the Raspi.
Now it&amp;rsquo;s time to move on and start to actually connect to the serial ports.</description>

      <description>As a network engineer I spend a lot of time with my laptop connected via serial cable to various devices.
Physical serial connection is needed for initial device setup and sometimes per customer&amp;rsquo;s security policy I can&amp;rsquo;t access the network, so I can only use out-of-band management. I also configure many devices at staging lab that I call the &amp;ldquo;Theory room&amp;rdquo; because you know, in theory everything works ;-)</description>
