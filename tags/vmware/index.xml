      <description>Today I passed exam VCP550 and got VMware VCP5-DCV certification.
Exam preparation For exam preparation I attended the official training that is mandatory to access the exam. The printed material provided with the training is good enough but I integrated with the great Mastering VMware vSphere 5.5 by Scott Lowe. The official documentation available online for free.
I had some hands-on experience with VSphere, did some installations myself and supported some trouble tickets so even if I don&amp;rsquo;t work every day with VSphere I have a decent knowledge on the topic.</description>
