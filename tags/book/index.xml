      <description>I got inspired by the book &amp;ldquo;The 1 Thing&amp;ldquo; and changed a little bit my behavior about work and training I&amp;rsquo;d like to share here to discuss and improve.
The Background A while ago one guy could setup a bunch of physical servers, install/configure/manage OS, configure network equipment and setup a firewall to connect to the internet.
For some specific software platforms the support of the vendor for installation and maintenance was enough.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;Breaking stupid rules for smart results.&amp;rdquo;
 Not the best book ever but I liked the concept: don&amp;rsquo;t stick to the rules if you feel the rules don&amp;rsquo;t allows to work in and efficient way.
Hacking work is actually intrapreneurship and requires a little anarchic spirit. How can we improve if we never try something different?
